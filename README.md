Hi there! My name is Amit Harel, and I'm a mechanical engineer with a passion for developing innovative solutions to complex problems.

I hold a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego. I have extensive experience as a Mechanical Engineer, having worked for a small company in Los Angeles, CA, from July 2016 to August 2019. During my time there, I contributed to the development of system, component, and installation designs for multiple production-level projects, including Auxiliary Power Units, Cooling Fans, Air Handling Units, and Environmental Control Units.

I have also worked on several exciting projects during my academic career, including a wildfire mitigation project at UC San Diego and an Autonomous Bird Deterrent at UC Davis. 

I am a dedicated and motivated engineer with a proven track record of success in a wide range of projects and applications. I am excited to continue exploring new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and expertise.
